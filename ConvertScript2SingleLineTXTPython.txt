Save SOT scripts to a txt file, then drop that into the notebook folder on Jupyter, then run this code: 

f = open("<name of txt file>.txt", "r")

a = f.read().split("###")
b = [i.strip() for i in a]
c = [' '.join(i.split("\n")) for i in b]

count=0
with open('<name of new txt file>.txt', 'w') as f:
    for i in c:
        count+=1
        f.write("SOT #"+str(count)+"\n")
        f.write(i.upper())
        f.write("\n\n")
f.close()
